Mixed Expressions

An expression that has operands of different data types is called a mixed expression.
A mixed expression

contains both integers and floating-point numbers. The following expressions are 
examples of mixed

Expressions:

2 + 3.5

6 / 4 + 3.9

5.4 * 2 - 13.6 + 18 / 2

Two rules apply when evaluating a mixed expression:

1. When evaluating an operator in a mixed expression:

a. If the operator has the same types of operands 
(that is, both are integers or both are floating-point numbers),

the operator is evaluated according to the type of the operand. Integer operands yield an integer result;

floating-point numbers yield a floating-point number result.

b. If the operator has both types of operands (that is, one is an integer 
and the other is a floating-point number),

during calculation the integer is treated temporarily as a floating-point 
number with the decimal part of zero,

and then the operator is evaluated. The result is a floating-point number.

2. The entire expression is evaluated according to the precedence rules. 
The multiplication, division, and modulus

operators are evaluated before the addition and subtraction operators. 
Operators having the same level of

precedence are evaluated from left to right. Grouping is allowed for clarity.

                                                           = 12 + 1 - 25.5                      7 / 5 = 1

                                                     = -12.5                               13 - 25.5 = 13.0 - 25.5 = -12.5

Logical expressions

Logical expression are also known as Boolean expressions. 
It will always evaluate to a value of either true or false. Therefore, 
they will be represented by the data type boolean. While they may seem similar to mathematical operators,
the difference lies in how they are used with comparative or boolean operators.

These expression consist of logical operators and relational expressions.

If two or more logical operators appear in an expression, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

for example the expression 4>4 II 3<1 && 11>4 II 2<5 evaluates to true.

Parenthesis are used to group expression and to control the operators in the expression.

For example: (4> 4 II 3<1) && (11>4 II 2<5) evaluates to FALSE.
